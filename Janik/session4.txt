# session 4: swiss train stations

ID of first query in session: 706207299

number of queries: 4

query evolution description: The user successively renames variables or replaces them with blank nodes. An IRI is replaced once and after the second query "DiSTINCT" is added.

user story:
The user starts by searching for the properties (and the corresponding objects) that are associated with a specific Swiss railroad station, but not with a specific other station.
The user then only tries to select the Wikidata properties. To do this, the user first tries to rename a variable, but ultimately replaces some variables with blank nodes. At the same time, only distinct properties are searched for.
In the last query, one of the railroad stations is replaced by another.
