**number of queries:** 3

**query evolution description:**

The query becomes more specific step by step by adding triple patterns and a filter.

**user story:**

In the initial query, the user is asked about science fiction authors and their place of birth.
The query is then restricted so that only authors born in the United Kingdom are included.
The last query then additionally requires that the authors were not born before 1900.
In general, the query results are limited to 100 elements. However, the last query returns no results because an invalid date format is used.
