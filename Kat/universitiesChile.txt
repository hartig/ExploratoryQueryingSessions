user story:
This user started from a query asking for universities in Chile and people who
were educated there.
Then they changed the query to ask for universities in Chile and coordinate
location, but did not include the coordinate location in the select clause, so
the coordinates did not appear in the results.
Then they asked for SELECT * and got the universities and their coordinates in
the third query.
