# Exploratory Querying Sessions
This repository contains a small collection of exploratory querying sessions discovered in Wikidata query logs. The term _exploratory querying_ refers to an activity in which a human user issues database queries with the goal of producing a query that captures a particular query intent. Notice that this is different from data exploration which focuses more on achieving an understanding of the content of a database or dataset rather than on developing a query to express a particular query intent.

Our primary goal when creating this collection was to test the hypothesis that the Wikidata query logs contain sessions that exhibit exploratory querying behavior.

The sessions are organized in separate directories (one per session), where each of these directories contains files with all the queries that belong to the session and a short description that summarizes how the query developed in the session evolves throughout the session. Additionally, we provide a brief "user story" for each session in which we hypothesize what the user's query intent was and why the session has evolved in the way it did.

**TODO** complete the readme ..
