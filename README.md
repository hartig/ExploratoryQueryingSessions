# Exploratory Querying Sessions
This repository contains a collection of exploratory querying sessions discovered in Wikidata query logs. Please submit one file per session. Our goal is for each of us to contribute 4 sessions.
Please consider using this structure for your session files. [Sample session file](https://github.com/hartig/ExploratoryQueryingSessions/blob/main/Kat/universitiesChile.txt) .

ID of first query in session: 

number of queries:

# Inspecting Queries
Visiting the URIs used in the queries allows us to see their labels and descriptions which could be helpful in understanding query intent.
It is possible to copy the queries and try them out using the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/). 

# Guidance
Janik provided additional structure in the document to indicate likely boundaries around sessions. These are approximations, if you inspect the session and find unrelated queries feel free to ignore them and provide the ID for the query that you believe to be the actual start of the session. 

We are hoping to gather sessions that contain evidence of exploratory querying. We do not want to collect sessions that seem to be examples of data exploration (ex. queries are repeated but one literal is changed). If a user story is difficult to imagine it may be a good sign to move on to another candidate session.
