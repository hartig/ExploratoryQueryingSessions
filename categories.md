# Categorization of the Sessions
By an initial analysis and comparison of the sessions in this collection, we observe that these sessions---and, thus, exploratory querying behavior in general---can be grouped into different categories. In particular, we identify the following six categories based on our collection of sessions. We emphasize that these categories are not mutually exclusive; some sessions fit into multiple categories. We also emphasize that these categories are not necessarily exhaustive; there may be more categories, which are not evident from the sessions in our collection.

## Category 1 - Result Refinement
During sessions within this category, the user modifies their query to limit the answers (rows) of the query result more and more. Typical query modifications in such sessions include the addition of further conditions, captured via FILTER expressions or via filtering triple patterns.

A typical example of a result-refinement session is [session14](https://github.com/hartig/ExploratoryQueryingSessions/tree/main/session14) in which the initial query retrieves science fiction authors and their respective place of birth; the subsequent queries are then becoming increasingly more restrictive regarding the selected authors (first, restricted to retrieve only authors born in the United Kingdom; thereafter, restricted further to filter out authors who were born before 1900).

The complete list of sessions that fit into this category is:
[session01](https://github.com/hartig/ExploratoryQueryingSessions/tree/main/session01),
[session05](https://github.com/hartig/ExploratoryQueryingSessions/tree/main/session05),
