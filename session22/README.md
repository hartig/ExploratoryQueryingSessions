**Extracted from chunk:** chunk_03.log

**ID of first query in session:** 747321618

**number of queries:** 4

**query evolution description:**

The user starts with a query to which an additional condition is added later. The results are also sorted from a certain query onwards and the limit is modified.

**user story:**

The user starts by searching for instances of cemeteries and requests an image of them, if available.
After that, the limit is increased and it is also required that the cemetery is located in Sweden.
The user then orders the results first by qualifier of the cemeteries and then according to their label, presumably because this is more suitable for human users.

**query03**

The results are now sorted in ascending order according to the cemetery's qualifier.

**query04**

The results are now sorted in ascending order according to the cemetery's name/label. (easier to read for people than using the qualifier to sort)
