# Method (TODO: rewrite this part)

Each of us has our own directory in this repo. There you will find a chunk of the log. We will each work with separate chunks of the log to find sessions that exemplify exploratory querying. Once you have found a session that shows the user doing exploratory querying, please use this template to describe the session. Please submit one file per session. Please add the files to the directory in this repo with your name. Our goal is for each of us to contribute descriptions of 4 sessions using this template.
Please use this template to describe your session files. Here is a [Sample session file](https://github.com/hartig/ExploratoryQueryingSessions/blob/main/Kat/universitiesChile.txt) for your reference.

ID of first query in session: 

number of queries:

query evolution description:

user story:

query 1:

query n:

# Inspecting Queries
Visiting the URIs used in the queries allows us to see their labels and descriptions which could be helpful in understanding query intent.
It is possible to copy the queries and try them out using the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/). 

# Guidance
Janik provided additional structure in the document to indicate likely boundaries around sessions. These are approximations, if you inspect the session and find unrelated queries feel free to ignore them and provide the ID for the query that you believe to be the actual start of the session.

We are hoping to gather sessions that contain evidence of exploratory querying. We do not want to collect sessions that seem to be examples of data exploration (ex. queries are repeated but one literal is changed). If a user story is difficult to imagine it may be a good sign to move on to another candidate session.
